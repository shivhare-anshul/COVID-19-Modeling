Steps to run the code: 

Please focus on Assignment_Da_3.ipynb, Assignmnet_Da_3.py 
(rest file is just for understanding of loss function and different dataframes generated by different beta)

In Assignmnet_Da_3.py file i did the training code, Where the model is trained using 16th march
to 26th april data, and found the optimized parameters.

The above optimized parameters are used to do prediction.
Prediction and data generation code is in predicting_data_using_beta file.
Here prediction is done using different beta values.


Note : Loss_calculating file(in Jupyter_files) is not needed. I am zipping so that you can see printed intermediate dataframe.
